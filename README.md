## Package: pilz_agv
The "pilz_agv" package is a ros package where contains all the necessary files for the visualisation of the virtual AGV, the process of converting the AGV speed to speeds that can be understood by the MD49 controller and the calculation of the AGV odometry to help with the localisation of AGV managers that are navigating autonomously.
